							<p>The full stack Java development process involves several stages, each focusing on a specific aspect of application development. From a full stack Java developer's perspective, the workflow can be broken down into the following steps:

								<br>Requirement Analysis: In this stage, the developer gathers the project requirements, understands the client's needs, and plans the project accordingly. This includes defining the scope, goals, and constraints of the application.
								
								<br>System Design: Based on the requirements, the developer creates a system design that outlines the architecture, database schema, and user interface (UI) design. This may involve creating wireframes, mockups, or prototypes to visualize the application structure.
								
								<br>Front-end Development: The developer begins implementing the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks/libraries such as Angular, React, or Vue). In Java-based applications, JavaServer Faces (JSF) or Thymeleaf can also be used for building the UI. The focus here is on creating an attractive, user-friendly, and responsive interface for the application.
								
								<br>Back-end Development: For Java-based back-end development, the developer leverages the Java programming language and frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, or Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE). This involves writing server-side logic, implementing APIs, and setting up database connections to ensure seamless data management and communication between the front-end and back-end.
								
								<br>Integration: In this stage, the developer integrates the front-end and back-end components, ensuring that data flows smoothly between them. This may involve connecting APIs, setting up web services, and configuring middleware.
								
								<br>Testing: The developer conducts thorough testing of the application, including unit, integration, and system tests. This ensures that the application is bug-free, performs as expected, and meets the project requirements.
								
								<br>Deployment: Once the application has been tested and is ready for release, the developer deploys it to a hosting environment, such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure. They also set up the necessary infrastructure, such as servers, databases, and networking components.
								
								<br>Maintenance and Updates: After the application is live, the developer continuously monitors its performance and addresses any issues that arise. This may involve bug fixes, security updates, or feature enhancements based on user feedback and requirements.
								
								<br>Throughout this workflow, the developer may also utilize version control systems (like Git) and project management methodologies (such as Agile or Scrum) to keep the project organized and ensure efficient collaboration within the team.</p>
